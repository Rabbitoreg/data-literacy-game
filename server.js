// WebSocket server removed - now using polling-based updates
// This file is no longer needed as the application uses Next.js API routes
// and client-side polling for real-time updates instead of WebSocket connections

console.log('WebSocket server has been removed. Application now uses polling-based updates.')
console.log('To start the application, use: npm run dev (which only starts Next.js on port 3000)')
